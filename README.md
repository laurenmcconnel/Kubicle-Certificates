# Kubicle-Certificates
Here I have a collection of certificates I generated from finishinf various courses in Kubicle. This includes courses for word, powerpoint and excel. Along with different python and Jupyter notebook courses, including how to use k-means clustering and classification techniques. I also completed courses on Statistical Analysis such as Linear Regression. I also completed courses on Tableau and SQL.
